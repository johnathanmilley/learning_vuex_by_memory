# A memory game made with Vuejs, vuex

## Purpose

Created in an attempt to learn something about vuex. I learned some things. 

Possible (unlikely) future features:
* Choose your own name on start
* Reset the board (refreshing does the trick)
* Updating the slightly underwhelming 'win screen'

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
